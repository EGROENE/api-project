# api-project
This is a project I'm working on for the Devslopes Academy. We are to implement an API using only HTML, CSS, & vanilla JavaScript. I will update this document further as I make progress.

Here are the project requirements:
* Fetch data from an API (resource provided below) and display up to 30 items from that request in your HTML.
- In your HTML you will display the array of data you get back (i.e. if it was an array of movies, you would display the list of movies).
- Display a minimum of 3 values from the object in the array of data you get back for each item. (i.e. movie name, movie description, cover image).
* HTML for each item should be created programmatically. This means the html is created  based on the data received from the API - if 10 items are fetched, 10 blocks of HTML are created to display the data, etc.
* Build a function to add selected items from the array of data to a "favorites" list. i.e.:
- You fetch a list of 30 movies from an API and display it in a "collection" in your HTML.
-When a user selects an item(s) from the "collection" to add to the "favorites" list, the item(s) are removed from the collection and added to the "favorites" list.
* Build a function to remove an item from the "favorites" list.
- When a user removes an item from the "favorites" list, the item is added back to the "collection" of items.
* Build a toggle function that sorts the items in the collection and "favorites" list alphabetically (A-Z) and vice versa (Z-A).
You must display the total sum of some piece of data from the list. (i.e. if you had a list of pokemon, you could total the number of common, rare and legendary pokemon in the list). You cannot total the number of items in the array, it must be a value from the data object.
* The website must be built with pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no third party css or js libraries).
* The items retrieved from the API must be displayed in styled HTML. (i.e. if you were working with the pokeAPI you could display the data in a "card" design with the image, attack, hitpoints, etc).
* The website must be mobile responsive across desktop, ipad/tablet and mobile phones.
